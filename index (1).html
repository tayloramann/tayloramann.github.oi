			<h2> Who is The Chameleon? </h2>
				<p>I am the type of person who unconcisouly mimics postures, mannerisms, 
facial expressions, and other's behaviors and actions. I also sometimes unintentionally 
changes my own actions actions to match that of of others in ones current social environment. But I do not necessarily mean to do this, but it is all in the actions of my unconscious. I would say I am a very special person, who is one of a kind. It is rare to be a Chameleon in this day and age, where everyone strives to be different from one another. But not for me, nope. I just want to be like everyone else around me.
 </p>
			
			<h3> I AM THE CHAMELEON! </h3>
				<p>Whether I am content with myself or not, I tend to model the actions of society 
around me without even thinking about it. Maybe I am not happy with myself and 
who I am as a person. I do not know. I first received the name Chameleon 
when I was in grade school. I was initially given this nickname when my friends started 
realizing that I was wearing what they were wearing, saying what they were saying, 
and acting how they were acting. Some would take that as a compliment, me doing
exactly as they were, but instead they named me the Chameleon. </p>
			
			<h2> Was I happy with that? </h2>
				<p> Truth is, it did not matter to me. As the Chameleon I acted exactly as my peers
around me. They all started calling me the Chameleon, so what did I do? I started
calling all of them the Chameleon too! What can I say, I am more myself when I am directly imitating the actions of others around me. I do not need my own identity. I want to be like everyone else around me so I fit in and so I feel like I belong. </p>

			<h4> Feature Video of the Week </h4>

			<p> This Fashion Guru, Martina, is one of my really great friends. We actually met in college freshmen year, as she was my roommate. 
			We lived very well together without fighting or getting mad at one another. We were both into fashion and how we looked, and we would 
			even borrow each others clothes sometimes. We got pretty close. I decided to interview her one day on her opinion of fashion and 
			how it personally affects her life. This video shown above was her first and only take of the interview. This video shows her passion
			for her fashion, as well as what it means to her. Martina is a great example of a fashion guru, and she is one of my inspirations! I think you guys 
			should check her out. She was even willing to let me post her contact information for anyone interested in speaking with her. martinalily@yahoo.com</p>
