			<h2> Who is The Chameleon? </h2>
				<p>The Chameleon is someone who unconcisouly mimics postures, mannerisms, 
facial expressions, and other behaviors and actions. This person untintentionally 
changes their actions to match that of of others in ones current social environment. This person does not necessarily mean to do this, but it is all in the actions of their unconscious. The Chameleon is a very special person, who is one of a kind. It is rare to be a Chameleon in this day and age, where everyone strives to be different from one another. But not for the Chameleon, nope. This person wants to be like everyone else around them.  </p>
			<h3> I AM THE CHAMELEON! </h3>
				<p>Whether I am content with myself or not, I tend to model the actions of society 
around me without even thinking about it. Maybe I am not happy with myself and 
who I am as a person. I do not know. I first received the name Chameleon 
when I was in grade school. I was initially given this nickname when my friends started 
realizing that I was wearing what they were wearing, saying what they were saying, 
and acting how they were acting. Some would take that as a compliment, me doing
exactly as they were, but instead they named me the Chameleon.
Since a lot of my friends have been traveling, I have been traveling as well. I joined the track and field team which lets me travel around the country. I like traveling and getting to know new areas of the world, because I believe there is so much to see out there.
There are so many different cultures and traditions in different places around the world, and I think everyone should be aware of all of them. If you are stuck in one area your whole entire life, you are unaware at what everyone else is doing. Who wants to live like that? Well obviously not me, because I am the Chameleon! I love being the Chameleon.
I love people and I love getting to know people of different cultures. That is how I know so much about the world. You can not learn as much as I have learned through a textbook, you just cannot.   </p>

			<h5> Special Guest: Martina the Fashion Guru. </h5>

				
			<p> This Fashion Guru, Martina, is one of my really great friends. We actually met in college freshmen year, as she was my roommate. 
			We lived very well together without fighting or getting mad at one another. We were both into fashion and how we looked, and we would 
			even borrow each others clothes sometimes. We got pretty close. I decided to interview her one day on her opinion of fashion and 
			how it personally affects her life. This video shown above was her first and only take of the interview. This video shows her passion
			for her fashion, as well as what it means to her. Martina is a great example of a fashion guru, and she is one of my inspirations! I think you guys 
			should check her out. She was even willing to let me post her contact information for anyone interested in speaking with her. martinalily@yahoo.com </p>
