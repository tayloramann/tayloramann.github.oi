		<h2> Fashion and Textile Designer </h2>
				<p>As many of you may know, I am a soon to be famous fashion designer. I have designed and hand created many scarves, hats, shirts, and jackets. One of my proudest and recent pieces is called <strong>"The Chic Swamp."</strong> 
				The ingredients I used to make this piece were tulle and embroidery floss. My main process for this piece shown below is by sewing the embroidery floss through the tulle, tying a few knots, and then cutting the floss. 
				I repeated these steps as many times as it took to make each green section complete. At first, I started using only one shade of green embroidery floss. However, I have gotten more brave because now I am using many 
				different shades of green. To me the piece feels complete. It is light and dainty, yet complex and dense. My favorite part of the piece is how the tulle makes the piece feel alive. What I mean by that is that if I hang 
				the piece from the ceiling, or on the wall, or even lay it out flat, I can sense some sort of motion in the piece.  </p>

<h2> Las Vegas Industry Trip </h2>
				<p> This last summer, I went to Las Vegas, Nevada with a small group of classmates in my retailing and consumer behavior program. We got to attend trend seminars where professional trendsetters and trend watchers presented the trends for Spring of 2017 to us. 
				I am not sure if I should share the future trends with all of you on this website, but if any of you want to personally reach out to me, I am more than willing to chat. 
				We also had the opportunity to shadow buyers and planners during their interactions with vendors at the trade shows. This was an amazing experience, because I got to learn about the whole process of being a buyer.
				My favorite part of this trip was learning about the industry while getting a first hand experience. This trip triggered my interest in fashion and retail to a whole new level.

<h2> San Diego Training Trip for Track and Field </h2>
			<p> I am a pole vaulter on the UW Track and Field team. For Spring break every year, our team takes a training trip where we get to 
			explore the beaches and the mountains of San Diego, and also train two times per day for the competition at the end of the trip.
			Last trip, my teammates and I explored many different beaches, got to try some new foods, and we go to compete against some really competitive schools out West.
			My favorite part of the trip was going to sunset beach and getting to see some seals! I have never seen a live seal before so it was really cool to see. 
			The weirdest part of the trip was accidentally going to a <strong>nude beach</strong>. After our competition, my teammates and I were not so happy with how we did so we took a hike. We ended 
			up walking a few miles and we discovered a hidden gem, and so we thought. We walked and walked and found ourselves on a cliff, overlooking the most beautiful beach we had ever seen.
			We were determined to get all the way to the bottom, so we decided to keep going. Good thing we were in our track shoes! 
			Eventually when we got to the bottom after about 20 minutes, we were in awe. The water was so beautiful, the sand was full of shells, and the sky was as blue and as clear as ever before. 
			But then we looked around us at the people laying down, playing ball, swimming, and walking around. They were all naked!!! We were so shocked, as none of us had ever been to a nude beach before, nor did we really want to. But we decided to stay and go for a swim!
